👋🏽  Hey there! My name is Ganesh Prasannah, but everyone knows me as [GP](https://httgp.com). 

I'm a web and infrastructure engineer & a problem solver at heart. I mostly work with Terraform and JavaScript-based runtimes & libraries like Node.js, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, TypeScript & React, and I focus on expressive, clean & performant code. I also work on DevOps & distributed systems; I'm super-comfortable with Ansible, Packer, Nomad, HAProxy, Apache Mesos & Kafka.

### 💬 What I love doing

1. Advocating for a better hiring pipeline.
2. Building inclusive, thoughtful and solid engineering teams.
3. Mentoring & bringing up talent.
4. Writing ~beautiful~ robust software.
5. [Blogging about things I love or learnt](https://httgp.com/).
6. Hunting down the perfect GIF for _every_ situation.

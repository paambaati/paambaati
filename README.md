👋🏽  Hey there! My name is Ganesh Prasannah, but everyone knows me as [GP](https://httgp.com). 

I'm an engineer & a problem solver at heart, and right now I'm helping build the future of digital freight forwarding at [Wiz](http://wizfreight.com/). I mostly work with JavaScript-based runtimes & libraries like Node.js, TypeScript & React, and I focus on expressive, clean & performant code. I also work on DevOps & distributed systems; I'm super-comfortable with Terraform, Ansible, Packer, HAProxy, Apache Mesos & Kafka.

### 💬 What I love doing

1. Building inclusive, thoughtful and great teams.
2. Mentoring & bringing up talent.
3. Writing ~beautiful~ robust software.
4. [Blogging about things I love or learnt](https://httgp.com/).
5. Hunting down the perfect GIF for _every_ situation.
